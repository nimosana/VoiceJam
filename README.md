## Voices Jam       
# Nicolas Morales-Sanabria

This is a p5.speech voice synthesizer & recognition experiment, it's an adaptation from a pong game made for CART-253. It allows the user to control their paddle, start the game and select opponents with their voice. The opponent in this case can be changed to different voices/languages.
